We do it by presenting a bunch of design patterns that, such as the authors of this model do, are based on the examples from prior works. That example involves collecting personal data for a retail shop. These following design patterns describe such provenance model representing a customer, Alice, interacting with that retail shop by registering, making purchases, and subscribing to marketing information. The design patterns 1-3 are proposed by Ujcich, Bates, Sanders. The next ones, we have introduced together with the analysis of the limitations and extensions the original model present (see more here ). 1. Data Collection and Consent by a Subject Figure 1: Alice registers her personal data with a retail shop and consents to use of her data for storage, purchases, and marketing. Note that Alice does not consent to use of her credit card number for being shared for marketing purposes, from Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. This current design patter assumes that Alice, at time \u03c4, registers her personal data to the retail shop, along with her consent. Note in Figure 1 that the provenace graph represents that register as a Collect activity. Since GDPR lays down that a lawful processing must have a given specific consent for that purpose, such graph represents that purpose by mapping Collect activity to Consent activity with the wasInformedBy relation and that Consent activity to ConsentRequest entities with the used relations. Also note in Figure 1 that Alice does not consent to use her credit card information for marketing purposes, bu she does allow it to be used for making purchases or for being stored by the retail shop ( e.g. , to simplify future purchases). 2. Data Transfers Among Controllers and Processors Figure 2: The retail shop uses Alice\u2019s data for marketing purposes by employing a third-party marketer. The retail shop uses Alice\u2019s consent to receive marketing in allowing the processor to receive Alice\u2019s name and address. (For simplicity, portions of the provenance graph from Figure 2 that are not relevant are not shown.), from Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. This second design pattern represents the case in which the retail shop, at time \u03c4 + 1, transfers some of Alice's data to a third-party that provide marketing services. The provenance graph, which Figure 2 shows, represents that transfering by using Disclose activity. Note that, since Alice does not consent to use of her credit card number for it purposes, this personal data is not shared for marketing. 3. Withdrawal by a Subject Figure 3: Alice no longer wishes to receive marketing information, so she withdraws her consent for use of her personal data for marketing purposes. Future marketing activities that attempt to use the \u201cConsent to Marketing\u201d as justification will be noncompliant, from Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. This design pattern describe the case in which Alice informs to retail shop, at time \u03c4 + 2, she no longer wish to receive any further marketing. This case should be represented by connecting WithdrawRequest entity to the Consent to Marketing activity, through wasEndedBy relation. Since the provenance model persists that connection, future Disclose processes, which use this Justify activity, after time \u03c4 + 2, will not occur. Figure 3 shows this case. 4. Transfer Data to an International Controller Figure 4: Holding Alice\u2019s consent, the retail shop intends to transfer Alice\u2019s data to an international retail shop. Note that Alice does not consent to use of her credit card number for being shared for a third party. After time \u03c4, the retail shop intends to transfer Alice's data to an international retail controller. Notice that now there is an association between controllers, which make it easier to identify the existence of the relation between those, through wasAssociatedWith . The Figure 5 shows the provenance graph generated from those activities. 5. Further Process for a Purpose Other Figure 5: At the time \u03c4 + 1, the retail shop intends to calculate the number of addresses in the same city by using personal data. Note that the subject did not consent for that purpose when its data were collected. Thus, that calculation uses pseudonymized data, and its purpose was considering compatible with Alice\u2019s consent for storing data. Take note also that, before time \u03c4 + \u03b4, Alice can beinformed the period in which her data will be stored. At the time \u03c4, Alice registers with and provides her data to the retail shop, along with her consent. At the same time, Alice informs her wish that her data must be erased at the time \u03c4 + \u03b4. At the time \u03c4 + 1, the retail shop intends to calculate the number of customers that share the same city by using the address of all customers for statistical purposes. Thus, the retail shop uses customers' pseudonymized-address. We represent those pseudonymized addresses in the provenance graph through the PseudonymizedData entity, as shown in Figure 5 . There must be only a single pseudonymized-address entity (regardless of the number of registered customers), which represents all customers' pseudonymized-address generated by Pseudonymize processes. This design pattern introduces ambiguity into relationships between data and data owners while enabling the subject to be aware of further processing. The lastest design pattern presented in this example is the compatibility relationship between two different purposes. Figure 5 shows that the purpose of calculating the number of customers that share the same city wasCompatibleWith Alice's consent to store her data.

The paper that they define such model was published in July 2018, in the 7th International Provenance and Annotation Workshop (IPAW). The authors start by identifying GDPR concepts. They present six rights they identify in the GPDR sections with provenance is applicable. They also identify one obligation, in which controllers must obey to get compliance with GDPR. We take those GDPR concepts of rights and obligations into Table 1 . Table 1: GDPR Concepts of Rights and Obligations as Applicable to Provenance, in Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. Concept Explanation Provenance Applicability Right to Consent [1, Arts. 6-8] Controllers and processors can lawfully process personal data when subjects have given consent \"for one or more specific purposes.\" Provenance can model the personal data for which consent has been given, the purposes for which consent is lawful, and the extent to which derived data are affected. Right to Withdrawal [1, Art. 7] Subjects can withdraw consent regarding their personal data\u2019s use going forward but without affecting such data\u2019s past use. Provenance can verify past compliance from before the withdrawal and prevent future use. Right to Explanation [1, Arts. 12-15] Subjects may ask controllers for explanations of how their data have been processed \"using clear and plain language.\" Provenance-aware systems can naturally provide such explanations by capturing past processing. Right to Removal [1, Art. 17] Controllers must inform processors if subjects wish to remove or erase their data. Provenance can track when such removal requests were made, what data such requests affect, and to what extent derived data are affected. Right to Portability [1, Art. 20] Subjects can request their data from controllers or ask controllers to transmit their data to other controllers directly. A common provenance model would allow each controller to link its respective provenance records with others' records. Obligation of Minimality [1, Art. 25] Controllers must not use any more data than necessary for a process. Provenance can help analyze such data uses with respect to processes. From this GDPR concepts, Ujcich, Bates, and Sanders recycle data-processing components of prior ontologies and define a GDPR data provenance model. Since controllers and processors must demonstrate that possessed-data processing is compliant with those GDPR concepts, thus the authors' model is controller-centric. Figure 2 shows this GDPR data provenance model with its high-level classes and their relations. Figure 2: Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. Some of those high-level classes include sublcasses either because they are found in prior ontologies or because their concepts are straightforward taken from the GDPR text. We bring the tables 2 , 3 and 4 from the model paper because they include the explaintion for those high-level classes and describe the subclasses. Table 2: GDPR Data Provenance Model Agent Classes, from Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. Class Explanation and Subclasses Subject An \"identifiable natural person [...] who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier\" [1, Art. 4]. Subclasses : Child subjects who cannot consent on their own and Parent subjects who can consent on their behalf [1, Art. 8]. Controller An organization \"which [...] determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data\" [1, Art. 4]. Subclasses : EURecipient controllers (with country subclasses), NonEURecipient controllers (with country subclasses). (Data processing or transmission that leaves the EU is subject to additional regulations [1, Arts. 44\u201350].) Processor An organization \"which processes personal data on behalf of the controller\" [1, Art. 4]. SupervisoryAutority \"An independent public authority\" [1, Arts. 4, 51\u201359] that can \"monitor and enforce the application of\" the GDPR and \"handle complaints lodged by a data subject [...] and investigate\" [1, Art. 57]. Table 3: GDPR Data Provenance Model Activity Classes, from Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. Class Explanation and Subclasses Process \"Any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means\" [1, Art. 4]. Subclasses : Collect , Store , Retrieve , Combine , Disclose to another controller or processor via transmission; Erase to destroy personal data to fulfill the right to erasure [1, Art. 17]; Profile using \"any form of automated processing . . . to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person\" [1, Art. 4]; or Pseudonymize by \"processing of personal data [so that it] can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information\" [1, Art. 4]. Justify The rationale that a controller uses in taking some action on personal data, which includes temporal notions of \"start\" and \"end\" times. Subclasses : a subject\u2019s Consent [1, Arts. 6\u20137]; a controller\u2019s Obligation , Interest , or Authority [1, Art. 6]. Table 4: GDPR Data Provenance Model Entity Classes, from Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. Class Explanation and Subclasses PersonalData An \"identifier [of a subject] such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the [...] identity of that natural person\" [1, Art. 4]. Subclasses : DerivedData simplifies identification of data derived wholly or in part from PersonalData objects (by some Process ). Request A request sent from a Subject to a Controller. Subclasses : ConsentRequest [1, Art. 6], WithdrawRequest [1, Art. 7], AccessRequest [1, Art. 15], CorrectionRequest [1, Art. 16], ErasureRequest [1, Art. 17], or a RestrictionRequest [1, Art. 18]. Justification A justification (beyond a subject\u2019s consent) for lawful processing. Subclasses : LegalObligation \"to which the controller is subject,\" a VitalInterest \"of the data subject or of another natural person,\" a \"performance of a task\" in the PublicInterest , an OfficialAuthority \"vested in the controller,\" a LegitimateInterest \"pursued by the controller,\" or a Contract \"to which the data subject is party\" [1, Art. 6]. Along with those classes, authors summarize extensions to several W3C PROV-DM relations by extending their semantic meanings. Table 5 explain those relations semantics. Table 5: GDPR Data Provenance Model Relation Semantics, from Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. From Relation To Semantic Meaning Process wasInformedBy Justify Data processing actions under the GDPR require justification; we can reason about why data exist or why data were removed. Justify wasDerivedFrom PersonalData Data updates, such as corrections submitted by the subject as part of the right to rectification [1, Art. 16]. PersonalData wasGeneratedBy or wasInvalidatedBy Process Personal data have lifespans. For instance, a subject may request that personal data be deleted. Both generation and invalidation require reasoning, so we use both relations. Justify used or wasEndendBy Request or Justification Justifications also have lifespans. For instance, a subject may withdraw his or her consent through a WithdrawRequest , which stops further data processing activities from using the Justify activity related to the withdraw request. Justify wasAssociatedWith Controller Justify activities are associated with controllers since controllers must keep such records for authorities; however, the information used to make the justification legal (i.e., a Request or Justification entity) can be attributed directly to the source that produced it (e.g., a Subject). Limitations & Extensions In this section, we present discussions concerning the difficulties we have found in mapping GDPR concepts in this GDPR data provenance model. While we did that, we found some limitations, for which we introduce extensions. We also consider as a limitation explicitly notions in the GDPR text that this data provenance model lacks in propose as class or subclasses. Those efforts to propose extensions for the limitations we found, we did a non-systematic read and interpretation of the GDPR text. While that, we tried to map the GDPR concept we identify in terms of this data provenance model. In case where it is not clear how should be this mapping, we introduce an extension. In summary, we have found eleven limitations in which the GDPR model does not cover some concept. We have classified all limitations and extensions into three types according to their impact on the model: The first one are plumbing extensions, which represent the deepest one, because they affect how the GDPR model works and also append new elements (Table 6 summarizes them). The remaining, porcelain and wallpaper extensions, Tables 7 and 8 , respectively, explain them. Both intend to clarify and enrich this GDPR data provenance model by either suggesting new subclasses that represent the semantic meanings of some part of the GDPR text or appending further information detailed in the law. Table 6: Plumbing extensions change the GDPR data provenance model high-level classes or relations by adding new elements or changing their use. GDPR Text Limitation Extension \"Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall provide [...] the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a thirdcountry or international organization [...].\" [Council of European Union 2016, point f) of Art. 13(1)]. The GDPR model enables subjects to know whether the controller intends to transfer their data; however, the model does not provide a direct relationship between the controllers. i) A new self-relationship ( wasAttributedTo ) for Controller ; and ii) useDiscloseclass to represent this transfer. \"The controller shall [...] provide the data subject with [...] the period for which [its] personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period\" [Council of EuropeanUnion 2016, point a) of Art.13(2)]. Although it is possible to represent when a purpose ends,the GDPR model authors\u2019 design patterns explicitly suggest the obtention of that purpose-ending information does not occur at the beginning. When a personal data are obtained, both startedAtTime and endedAtTime relations should be created with their Time annotation, denoting the Valid Time [Ozsoyoglu and Snod-grass 1995], those personal data will be stored. \"Where the controller intends to further process [...] for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were collected, the controller shall\" reveal to data subject its intentions. [Council of EuropeanUnion 2016, Art. 13(3)]. The GDPR model does not inform whether a Justify is compatible with another one. i) A new self-relationship ( wasCompatibleWith ) for Justify ; ii) A new PseudonymizedData class, a subclass of PersonalData ; and iii) that all processes informed by a Justify that wasCompatibleWith another must only use PseudonymizedData [Council of European Union 2016, pointe) of Art. 6(4)]. Table 7: Porcelain extensions are focused on improving the GDPR data provenance model understanding by providing new subclasses to express specific points of the GDPR articles. Limitation Extension The further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes are often cited in the text of the law [Council of European Union 2016, Art. 5, 9,14, 17, 21, 89]. A new ArchivingResearchingStatisticalPurposesJustify class, as sublclass of Justify ,which represents those purposal. Article 9 lists a set of purposes categories of personal data, which demands special justification to process. [Council of European Union 2016, Art. 9(1)] We suggest the following new classes, all of them subclasses of PersonalData : RacialEthnicData , PoliticalOpinionsData , BeliefData , MembershipData , GeneticData , BiometricData , HealthData , SexLifeData , and SexualOrientationData . Points b), d), e), and i) of Article 9 explain situations in which the special categories of personal data must not be prohibited [Council of European Union 2016, Art. 9(2)]. We suggest the following new classes: EmploymentSecurityObligation , as a subclass of LegalObligation (point b)); CommunityInterest (point b)) and PublicHealthInterest (point i)), both subclasses of PublicInterest ; and PublicData , as a subclass of PersonalData , and Publish , as a subclass of Process (point e)). Article 16 lay down rectification processes;however, the GDPR model does not proposea class representing that. A new Rectification , as a subclass of Process ,that represents a processing of rectification. Article 21 defines the right of objection; however, the GDPR model does not propose a class to represent this right. A new class ObjectionRequest , as a subclass of Request , that represents a subject\u2019s objection. Table 8: Plumbing extensions change the GDPR data provenance model high-level classes or relations by adding new elements or changing their use. GDPR Text Limitation Extension \"The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller [...] any available information as to their source.\" [Council of European Union 2016, point g) of Art. 15(1)]. The GDPR model does not present any information about the data source. A new SourceExplanation entity, in which a PersonalData is associated with it, representing a document that describes the source of this data. \"The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller [...] the existence of automated decision-making [...] [and] meaningful information about the logic involved [...].\" [Council of European Union 2016, point h) of Art. 15(1)] The GDPR model does not present any that different information about the existence of automated decision-making. A new AlgorithmExplanation entity, in which an automated Process is associated with it, representing a document that describes the logic involved in that process. \"Where personal data are transferred [...] the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards [...].\" [Council of European Union 2016, Art.15(2)] such as describe Art. 46, 47, and 49, also \"the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available\" [Council of European Union 2016, point f) of Art.13(1), 14(1)]. The GDPR model does not represent any information about the appropriate safeguards of the controller, by concerning their availability to lawfully transfer of personal data. A new EvaluationOfAdequacy entity, in which a Controller is associated with it, representing a document that describes that required information. Provide the data subject with the period for which their data will be stored Our first concern addresses the period for which each personal data will be stored.Both articles 13 and 14 [Council of European Union 2016, Arts 13, 14] prescribe what further information the controllers must provide to subjects whose personal data are collected. Into those, we found that the GDPR model does not cover the point a), which forces controllers to inform to subjects \"the period for which [their] personal data will be stored [...]\" [Council of European Union 2016, point a) of Article 12(2)].Currently, the GDPR model represents this period into the startedAtTime and endedAtTime relations, which connects Justify entities to Time annotation, thus preserving the timing information of activity compliance. However, as far as we understand it, the text of this provenance model design suggests that those relations should be created either when its Justify entity is logically present in the database (i.e., creating startedAtTime relation) or when a specific Request is made (i.e., creating endedAtTime relation).This method to capture timing information is known in the literature by Transaction Time [Ozsoyoglu and Snodgrass 1995]. An example that enforces this understanding isthe first design pattern introduced by Ujcich, Bates, and Sanders, which describes the use of this provenance model when a user \"registers with and provides [its] personaldata [...], along with [its] consent\" [Ujcich et al. 2018, p. 5]. We notice that the GDPR model creates only startedAtTime relation, at this moment. In order to represent the period that personal data will be stored, we understand that it is enough to create both startedAtTime and endedAtTime relations, with their Time annotation denoting the Valid Time [Ozsoyoglu and Snodgrass 1995]. In a word, at the time the personal data are collected, along with its consents, controllers must inform to GDPR data provenance model of the real-time period between this data could be stored. In terms of this provenance model, it means the creation of both startedAtTime and endedAtTime relations, at the time of data collection. Reveal to data subject further processes Another limitation we have found in this model is concerning to the representation of the personal data use for a purpose other than the one for which they were collected.Article 5 establishes that \"personal data shall be [...] collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes\". However, Article 5 lays down that some types of \"further processing[...] shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible withthe initial purposes\" [Council of European Union 2016, point b) of Art. 5(1)]. Therefore, we conclude that some types of treatments can be processed, regardless of they holding a specific justification for them, whereas their justification is compatible with another valid one. In addition, the subject should be aware \"prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and with any further relevant information [...]\" [Council of European Union 2016, Art. 13(3)]. The problem is that since Article 89 requires pseudonymization [Council of European Union 2016, Art. 4(5)], it is impossible to attribute who is the owner of data, whose data will suffer those further processing. In conclusion, in order to represent the compatibility between two justifications, we propose the auto-relation wasCompatibleWith for Justify , in which Article 6(4) prescribes the rules for valid compatibility. Secondly, in order to represent those further processing, which they are subject to Article 89, we also propose the PseudonymizedData entity, which can not be attributed to a Subject , and it is generated by all Pseudonymize processes, which used data from any subject.","title":"GDPR Data Provenance Model"},{"location":"gdpr-data-provenance-model/#gdpr-data-provenance-model","text":"","title":"GDPR Data Provenance Model"},{"location":"gdpr-data-provenance-model/#gdpr-background","text":"In this page, we introduce the GDPR Data Provenance Model proposed by Ujcich, Bates, and Sanders. The paper that they define such model was published in July 2018, in the 7th International Provenance and Annotation Workshop (IPAW). The authors start by identifying GDPR concepts. They present six rights they identify in the GPDR sections with provenance is applicable. They also identify one obligation, in which controllers must obey to get compliance with GDPR. We take those GDPR concepts of rights and obligations into Table 1 . Table 1: GDPR Concepts of Rights and Obligations as Applicable to Provenance, in Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. Concept Explanation Provenance Applicability Right to Consent [1, Arts. 6-8] Controllers and processors can lawfully process personal data when subjects have given consent \"for one or more specific purposes.\" Provenance can model the personal data for which consent has been given, the purposes for which consent is lawful, and the extent to which derived data are affected. Right to Withdrawal [1, Art. 7] Subjects can withdraw consent regarding their personal data\u2019s use going forward but without affecting such data\u2019s past use. Provenance can verify past compliance from before the withdrawal and prevent future use. Right to Explanation [1, Arts. 12-15] Subjects may ask controllers for explanations of how their data have been processed \"using clear and plain language.\" Provenance-aware systems can naturally provide such explanations by capturing past processing. Right to Removal [1, Art. 17] Controllers must inform processors if subjects wish to remove or erase their data. Provenance can track when such removal requests were made, what data such requests affect, and to what extent derived data are affected. Right to Portability [1, Art. 20] Subjects can request their data from controllers or ask controllers to transmit their data to other controllers directly. A common provenance model would allow each controller to link its respective provenance records with others' records. Obligation of Minimality [1, Art. 25] Controllers must not use any more data than necessary for a process. Provenance can help analyze such data uses with respect to processes. From this GDPR concepts, Ujcich, Bates, and Sanders recycle data-processing components of prior ontologies and define a GDPR data provenance model. Since controllers and processors must demonstrate that possessed-data processing is compliant with those GDPR concepts, thus the authors' model is controller-centric. Figure 2 shows this GDPR data provenance model with its high-level classes and their relations. Figure 2: Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. Some of those high-level classes include sublcasses either because they are found in prior ontologies or because their concepts are straightforward taken from the GDPR text. We bring the tables 2 , 3 and 4 from the model paper because they include the explaintion for those high-level classes and describe the subclasses. Table 2: GDPR Data Provenance Model Agent Classes, from Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. Class Explanation and Subclasses Subject An \"identifiable natural person [...] who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier\" [1, Art. 4]. Subclasses : Child subjects who cannot consent on their own and Parent subjects who can consent on their behalf [1, Art. 8]. Controller An organization \"which [...] determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data\" [1, Art. 4]. Subclasses : EURecipient controllers (with country subclasses), NonEURecipient controllers (with country subclasses). (Data processing or transmission that leaves the EU is subject to additional regulations [1, Arts. 44\u201350].) Processor An organization \"which processes personal data on behalf of the controller\" [1, Art. 4]. SupervisoryAutority \"An independent public authority\" [1, Arts. 4, 51\u201359] that can \"monitor and enforce the application of\" the GDPR and \"handle complaints lodged by a data subject [...] and investigate\" [1, Art. 57]. Table 3: GDPR Data Provenance Model Activity Classes, from Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. Class Explanation and Subclasses Process \"Any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means\" [1, Art. 4]. Subclasses : Collect , Store , Retrieve , Combine , Disclose to another controller or processor via transmission; Erase to destroy personal data to fulfill the right to erasure [1, Art. 17]; Profile using \"any form of automated processing . . . to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person\" [1, Art. 4]; or Pseudonymize by \"processing of personal data [so that it] can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information\" [1, Art. 4]. Justify The rationale that a controller uses in taking some action on personal data, which includes temporal notions of \"start\" and \"end\" times. Subclasses : a subject\u2019s Consent [1, Arts. 6\u20137]; a controller\u2019s Obligation , Interest , or Authority [1, Art. 6]. Table 4: GDPR Data Provenance Model Entity Classes, from Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. Class Explanation and Subclasses PersonalData An \"identifier [of a subject] such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the [...] identity of that natural person\" [1, Art. 4]. Subclasses : DerivedData simplifies identification of data derived wholly or in part from PersonalData objects (by some Process ). Request A request sent from a Subject to a Controller. Subclasses : ConsentRequest [1, Art. 6], WithdrawRequest [1, Art. 7], AccessRequest [1, Art. 15], CorrectionRequest [1, Art. 16], ErasureRequest [1, Art. 17], or a RestrictionRequest [1, Art. 18]. Justification A justification (beyond a subject\u2019s consent) for lawful processing. Subclasses : LegalObligation \"to which the controller is subject,\" a VitalInterest \"of the data subject or of another natural person,\" a \"performance of a task\" in the PublicInterest , an OfficialAuthority \"vested in the controller,\" a LegitimateInterest \"pursued by the controller,\" or a Contract \"to which the data subject is party\" [1, Art. 6]. Along with those classes, authors summarize extensions to several W3C PROV-DM relations by extending their semantic meanings. Table 5 explain those relations semantics. Table 5: GDPR Data Provenance Model Relation Semantics, from Ujcich, B., Bates, A., Sanders, W. A Provenance Model for the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In IPAW 2018. From Relation To Semantic Meaning Process wasInformedBy Justify Data processing actions under the GDPR require justification; we can reason about why data exist or why data were removed. Justify wasDerivedFrom PersonalData Data updates, such as corrections submitted by the subject as part of the right to rectification [1, Art. 16]. PersonalData wasGeneratedBy or wasInvalidatedBy Process Personal data have lifespans. For instance, a subject may request that personal data be deleted. Both generation and invalidation require reasoning, so we use both relations. Justify used or wasEndendBy Request or Justification Justifications also have lifespans. For instance, a subject may withdraw his or her consent through a WithdrawRequest , which stops further data processing activities from using the Justify activity related to the withdraw request. Justify wasAssociatedWith Controller Justify activities are associated with controllers since controllers must keep such records for authorities; however, the information used to make the justification legal (i.e., a Request or Justification entity) can be attributed directly to the source that produced it (e.g., a Subject).","title":"GDPR Background"},{"location":"gdpr-data-provenance-model/#limitations-extensions","text":"In this section, we present discussions concerning the difficulties we have found in mapping GDPR concepts in this GDPR data provenance model. While we did that, we found some limitations, for which we introduce extensions. We also consider as a limitation explicitly notions in the GDPR text that this data provenance model lacks in propose as class or subclasses. Those efforts to propose extensions for the limitations we found, we did a non-systematic read and interpretation of the GDPR text. While that, we tried to map the GDPR concept we identify in terms of this data provenance model. In case where it is not clear how should be this mapping, we introduce an extension. In summary, we have found eleven limitations in which the GDPR model does not cover some concept. We have classified all limitations and extensions into three types according to their impact on the model: The first one are plumbing extensions, which represent the deepest one, because they affect how the GDPR model works and also append new elements (Table 6 summarizes them). The remaining, porcelain and wallpaper extensions, Tables 7 and 8 , respectively, explain them. Both intend to clarify and enrich this GDPR data provenance model by either suggesting new subclasses that represent the semantic meanings of some part of the GDPR text or appending further information detailed in the law. Table 6: Plumbing extensions change the GDPR data provenance model high-level classes or relations by adding new elements or changing their use. GDPR Text Limitation Extension \"Where personal data relating to a data subject are collected from the data subject, the controller shall provide [...] the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a thirdcountry or international organization [...].\" [Council of European Union 2016, point f) of Art. 13(1)]. The GDPR model enables subjects to know whether the controller intends to transfer their data; however, the model does not provide a direct relationship between the controllers. i) A new self-relationship ( wasAttributedTo ) for Controller ; and ii) useDiscloseclass to represent this transfer. \"The controller shall [...] provide the data subject with [...] the period for which [its] personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period\" [Council of EuropeanUnion 2016, point a) of Art.13(2)]. Although it is possible to represent when a purpose ends,the GDPR model authors\u2019 design patterns explicitly suggest the obtention of that purpose-ending information does not occur at the beginning. When a personal data are obtained, both startedAtTime and endedAtTime relations should be created with their Time annotation, denoting the Valid Time [Ozsoyoglu and Snod-grass 1995], those personal data will be stored. \"Where the controller intends to further process [...] for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were collected, the controller shall\" reveal to data subject its intentions. [Council of EuropeanUnion 2016, Art. 13(3)]. The GDPR model does not inform whether a Justify is compatible with another one. i) A new self-relationship ( wasCompatibleWith ) for Justify ; ii) A new PseudonymizedData class, a subclass of PersonalData ; and iii) that all processes informed by a Justify that wasCompatibleWith another must only use PseudonymizedData [Council of European Union 2016, pointe) of Art. 6(4)]. Table 7: Porcelain extensions are focused on improving the GDPR data provenance model understanding by providing new subclasses to express specific points of the GDPR articles. Limitation Extension The further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes are often cited in the text of the law [Council of European Union 2016, Art. 5, 9,14, 17, 21, 89]. A new ArchivingResearchingStatisticalPurposesJustify class, as sublclass of Justify ,which represents those purposal. Article 9 lists a set of purposes categories of personal data, which demands special justification to process. [Council of European Union 2016, Art. 9(1)] We suggest the following new classes, all of them subclasses of PersonalData : RacialEthnicData , PoliticalOpinionsData , BeliefData , MembershipData , GeneticData , BiometricData , HealthData , SexLifeData , and SexualOrientationData . Points b), d), e), and i) of Article 9 explain situations in which the special categories of personal data must not be prohibited [Council of European Union 2016, Art. 9(2)]. We suggest the following new classes: EmploymentSecurityObligation , as a subclass of LegalObligation (point b)); CommunityInterest (point b)) and PublicHealthInterest (point i)), both subclasses of PublicInterest ; and PublicData , as a subclass of PersonalData , and Publish , as a subclass of Process (point e)). Article 16 lay down rectification processes;however, the GDPR model does not proposea class representing that. A new Rectification , as a subclass of Process ,that represents a processing of rectification. Article 21 defines the right of objection; however, the GDPR model does not propose a class to represent this right. A new class ObjectionRequest , as a subclass of Request , that represents a subject\u2019s objection. Table 8: Plumbing extensions change the GDPR data provenance model high-level classes or relations by adding new elements or changing their use. GDPR Text Limitation Extension \"The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller [...] any available information as to their source.\" [Council of European Union 2016, point g) of Art. 15(1)]. The GDPR model does not present any information about the data source. A new SourceExplanation entity, in which a PersonalData is associated with it, representing a document that describes the source of this data. \"The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller [...] the existence of automated decision-making [...] [and] meaningful information about the logic involved [...].\" [Council of European Union 2016, point h) of Art. 15(1)] The GDPR model does not present any that different information about the existence of automated decision-making. A new AlgorithmExplanation entity, in which an automated Process is associated with it, representing a document that describes the logic involved in that process. \"Where personal data are transferred [...] the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards [...].\" [Council of European Union 2016, Art.15(2)] such as describe Art. 46, 47, and 49, also \"the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available\" [Council of European Union 2016, point f) of Art.13(1), 14(1)]. The GDPR model does not represent any information about the appropriate safeguards of the controller, by concerning their availability to lawfully transfer of personal data. A new EvaluationOfAdequacy entity, in which a Controller is associated with it, representing a document that describes that required information.","title":"Limitations &amp; Extensions"},{"location":"gdpr-data-provenance-model/#provide-the-data-subject-with-the-period-for-which-their-data-will-be-stored","text":"Our first concern addresses the period for which each personal data will be stored.Both articles 13 and 14 [Council of European Union 2016, Arts 13, 14] prescribe what further information the controllers must provide to subjects whose personal data are collected. Into those, we found that the GDPR model does not cover the point a), which forces controllers to inform to subjects \"the period for which [their] personal data will be stored [...]\" [Council of European Union 2016, point a) of Article 12(2)].Currently, the GDPR model represents this period into the startedAtTime and endedAtTime relations, which connects Justify entities to Time annotation, thus preserving the timing information of activity compliance. However, as far as we understand it, the text of this provenance model design suggests that those relations should be created either when its Justify entity is logically present in the database (i.e., creating startedAtTime relation) or when a specific Request is made (i.e., creating endedAtTime relation).This method to capture timing information is known in the literature by Transaction Time [Ozsoyoglu and Snodgrass 1995]. An example that enforces this understanding isthe first design pattern introduced by Ujcich, Bates, and Sanders, which describes the use of this provenance model when a user \"registers with and provides [its] personaldata [...], along with [its] consent\" [Ujcich et al. 2018, p. 5]. We notice that the GDPR model creates only startedAtTime relation, at this moment. In order to represent the period that personal data will be stored, we understand that it is enough to create both startedAtTime and endedAtTime relations, with their Time annotation denoting the Valid Time [Ozsoyoglu and Snodgrass 1995]. In a word, at the time the personal data are collected, along with its consents, controllers must inform to GDPR data provenance model of the real-time period between this data could be stored.
